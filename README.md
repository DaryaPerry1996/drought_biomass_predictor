#Introduction
##Background
In the Mediterranean climate, plants have evolved under conditions of low soil-water and nutrient availabilities and have acquired a series of adaptive traits that, in turn exert strong feedback on soil fertility, structure, and protection. As a result, plant-soil systems constitute complex interactive webs where these adaptive traits allow plants to maximize the use of scarce resources.( Sardans et al. 2013) . The long-term evolutionary adaptation to drought of Mediterranean plants allows them to cope with moderate increases of drought without significant losses of production and survival in some species.
Mediterranean-type climates are defined by temperate, wet winters, and warm or hot dry summers, winter storms bring precipitation and the summers are dry. (Seager et al. 2019)
All Mediterranean Regions are overall semiarid as a result of the highly seasonal precipitation and long dry summers and all struggle with water resources at the best of times. Lying between the more arid subtropics and the more humid extratropics they are locations of impactful climate variability and are highly vulnerable to intense and protracted droughts (e.g., Hurrell 1995; Smith et al. 2000; Risbey et al. 2009; Seager et al. 2014a; Cook et al. 2016; Garreaud et al. 2017).
The effects of climate change on Mediterranean ecosystems are profound and multifaceted, impacting soil moisture, pasture productivity  and biogeochemical cycles. These changes threaten the sustainability and functionality of these ecosystems, necessitating urgent attention and adaptive management strategies.
Rising global temperatures have led to decreased soil moisture, particularly in Mediterranean regions, which is critical for crop growth and ecosystem stability (Huang et al. 2024). The reduction in soil moisture can lead to increased aridity, affecting plant health and agricultural productivity.
 Climate change is altering the productivity and nutritional quality of pastures in Mediterranean silvopastoral systems, with increased temperatures and reduced rainfall negatively impacting biomass and nutrient composition(Martins-Noguerol et al., 2023).
Mediterranean forests are experiencing disruptions in carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles due to combined effects of drought and warming, leading to significant ecological consequences(Serrano et al. 2023). These changes can alter nutrient availability and soil organic matter, impacting overall ecosystem functioning.
##Projected changes:
The Mediterranean region is one of the most responsive areas to climate change and was identified as a major “hot-spot” based on global climate change analyses.
The Mediterranean has long stood out in successive generations of global climate models (GCMs) as being particularly sensitive to rising concentrations of greenhouse gases. Models overwhelmingly project, across all scenarios, a large reduction in precipitation, more than in other land regions in relative terms (Fig. 1b) (Giorgi and Lionello 2008; Planton et al. 2012). A large part of that decline occurs during winter, with enhanced drying over northwestern Africa [from 230% to 240% in December–February (DJF) precipitation] and the eastern Mediterranean (from 220% to 225%). In summer, significant warming and drying is also projected for the northern Mediterranean (Brogli et al. 2019).
All models predict a steady and significant warming across all study areas, accompanied by moderate changes in total annual precipitation, though with some seasonal variations. Future drought patterns in the Mediterranean region were analyzed based on the maximum duration of heat waves, their peak temperatures, and the number of consecutive dry days. The findings indicate an expected increase in both the duration and intensity of heat waves, as well as a rise in the maximum number of consecutive dry days across most study areas. (Valeria Todaro et al., 2022)
The projected impacts of climate change pose significant risks to both societies and the environment in the Mediterranean region. A decline in future precipitation combined with increased evapotranspiration could easily trigger critical water shortages, especially in areas where water resources are already at precarious levels (Iglesias et al. 2007; García-Ruiz et al. 2011). Rising temperatures associated with climate change are expected to affect human health (Diffenbaugh et al. 2007), disrupt plant life cycles (Gordo and Sanz 2010), and elevate fire risk (Moriondo et al. 2006). Of particular concern are the consequences for agriculture, with studies highlighting potential reductions in crop yields and food security (Iglesias et al. 2011; Bindi and Olesen 2011; Tanasijevic et al. 2014; Saadi et al. 2015). In essence, climate change is likely to decrease the availability of crucial ecosystem services (Schröter et al. 2005).
While the evidence highlights the severe impacts of climate change on Mediterranean ecosystems, it is also essential to consider the potential for adaptive management strategies that could mitigate these effects and promote ecosystem resilience. Understanding the nature and effect of Climate relations on mediterranean ecosystems is crucial in order to develop such strategies.
##Random Forest and other ML Models:
Machine learning models are highly useful in understanding the effects of climate on biomass due to their ability to handle complex datasets, integrate diverse variables, and provide accurate predictions. These models can effectively analyze the intricate relationships between climate variables and biomass, offering insights that traditional methods may not capture.
 Machine learning models, such as random forests and support vector machines, can manage large datasets with numerous variables, including both biotic and abiotic factors, which are crucial for accurate biomass estimation( e.g: Huntington et al. 2020 , Liu et al. 2023 , Xiao He et al. 2022 ·)
These models have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting biomass under various climate scenarios. For instance, random forest models have been used to predict sorghum yields and forest biomass with high precision, considering factors like greenhouse gas emissions and irrigation practices (e.g:  Huntington et al. 2020 , Xiao He et al. 2022, · Ghosh et al. 2018 )
These characteristics make random forest regressors an excellent candidate for providing Insights into Climate-Biomass Relationships.
This study aims to examine the effects of climate factors (temperature, rainfall patterns)  under the different drought treatments and categorize complex relations between climate factors on above-ground biomass in Mediterranean climate . More specifically, our study focuses on achieving the following objectives: (1) to utilize a random forest regressor model to predict above-ground biomass (2) to extract influental climate  factors and describe the nature of their influence.
##Materials and Methods:
Biomass data from 2002-2010:
Biomass samples were cultivated in plots in the matta rainout shelters under three different drought treatments I,C,D. During this time period the biomass was harvested in 15 plots (5 per treatment) with 10 replications per plot, each replication is a 20 x 20 cm quadrate within the plots.
Treatment I was irrigated 33% more then the natural precipitation.
Treatment C received the naturally occurring precipitation.
Treatment D received 66% of the naturally occurring precipitation ( 33% of the plot was covered such that only 66% of rainfall reached the plots)
Biomass data from 2011-2017- The samples were collected from rainout shelters under three different treatments I,C,D this data did not include the individual samples but rather the mean of all plots and replications per year per treatment.
Biomass data from 2018-2024: the samples were collected from rainout shelters under four different treatments  D,D66-HF,D66-LF,C from 2018 until 2021(treatments D66-HF,D66-LF were not used in the final training of the model) . from 2021 all D treatments were changed to D66 treatments. During this time period the biomass was harvested in 5 Blocks with 4 plots(Treatments) per Block 5 Replications per plot (one treatment per plot or 4 treatments per block). 
Treatment D66 recieved 33% of the naturally occurring precipitation( 66% of the plot was covered such that only 33% of rainfall reached the plots)
The biomass samples were harvested yearly in April then dried and weighed in the lab.
